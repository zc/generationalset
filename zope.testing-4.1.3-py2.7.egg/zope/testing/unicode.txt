=============
Unicode tests
=============

This section is about regression tests of ``zope.testing`` itself.
None of these tests make sense in Python 3.

  >>> from zope.testing.doctest import *

LP #69988 and #144569 both assert that doctests fail when rendering
non-ASCII output with a UnicodeDecodeError.  However, this does not appear
to be so:

  >>> print u'abc'
  abc

  >>> print u'\xe9'.encode('utf-8')
  Ã©

Tests for LP #561568:

  >>> v = u'foo\xe9bar'
  >>> v # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
  u'foo...bar'

  >>> v.encode('utf-8') # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
  'foo...bar'
